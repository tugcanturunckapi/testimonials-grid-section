### What I learned

The best thing I learnt in this contest is how to set up the grid structure in CSS. how to use a hover effect that when hovering over an element affects all elements before and after that element. Using an effect that works like a generic sibling that also selects previous elements. You can see this in the focus effect I applied to the card section of my website.
